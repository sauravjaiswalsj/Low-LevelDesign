# Library Management System Design
## Problem Statement:

### Design a Library Management System that can handle the following functionalities:

* Book Management:
  1. Add a new book to the library.
  2. Remove a book from the library.
  3. Update book information (e.g., title, author, genre).
  4. Search for a book by title, author, or genre.
  
* Member Management:
  1. Add a new member to the library. 
  2. Remove a member from the library. 
  3. Update member information (e.g., name, contact information). 
  4. Search for a member by name or ID.

* Borrowing and Returning:
  1. Borrow a book. 
  2. Return a book. 
  3. Check the status of a book (e.g., available, borrowed).

* Fine Management:
  1. Calculate fines for overdue books. 
  2. Handle payments for fines. 
  
* Reservation System:
  1. Allow members to reserve books. 
  2. Notify members when reserved books are available.

* Reports:
  1. Generate reports on book usage, fines collected, etc.
  
* Authentication and Authorization:
  1. Secure access to the system with authentication. 
  2. Implement different roles (e.g., librarian, member) with appropriate permissions.


### Considerations:

* Books can have multiple copies, and each copy has its own unique identifier. 
* Members should have unique IDs. 
* Implement a system to handle book availability, especially for multiple copies of the same book. 
* Design the system to handle reservations, ensuring fairness in book distribution.
